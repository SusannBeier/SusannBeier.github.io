            <br/>
            <div style="float:right; width:260px;">
	          <img src="images/atlas.png" width="250" height="250" alt="projects" />
	        </div>
	        <div style="float:left; width:600px;">
		  	  <p> Just like we come in all different sizes and shape, our arteries do too. This shape influences the vessel's blood flow, just like the water flow in a river bed. When flow regions are more rapid at the vessel wall then the inner-most vessel cells can get injured. This can allow plaque disease to enter and to accumulate over time, gradually blocking the vessel and preventing sufficient blood supply. Similarly, if the blood flow is slow or stagnant in a vessel corner or bend, then disease accumulates. Both extreme flow regions can be dangerous over long periods of time. The specific shape of the vessel determines these flow zones. If you have a very bend vessel, or a particularly wide vessel branch - you might be at risk. </p>
			  <p> We are currently expanding the largest database of population vessel shape to date. Sophisticated statistics can help us to understand which groups are at higher risk before disease stage is severe. Experimental testing and super-computing of the blood flow are just some of the powerful tools we use to drive this research further. </p>
			  <p> Ultimately, this can help heart disease patients worldwide by providing a reliable and early risk assessment, improving patient care and enabling patient-specific treatment. </a></p>

		    <h3>Stent Optimisation</h3>
            <br/>
            <div style="float:left; width:200px;">
	          <img src="images/stent.png" width="250" height="250" alt="projects" />
	        </div>
	        <div style="float:right; width:600px;">
		  	  <p> Stents are tiny meshed wired tubes which function as scaffolds to re-open blocked blood vessels narrowed by disease. Artery disease remains the single largest killer in this world. Statistically every 4th person will die from its consequences with a grim future outlook on improvement. Stents are usually very effective and are often the most preferred treatment method for later stage disease. </p>
			  <p> More than 2 million stents are implanted every year worldwide, yet nearly 10% of them still fail. Think about it, that's more than 200,000 affected patients every year. Additional procedures, expensive drug treatment and severely limited enjoyment of life are just a few of the consequences. </p>
			  <p> Our team made it their goal to understand the reasons WHY stents fail, how we can improve them and help more patients effectively. </p>

			<h3> Going Large - Dynamic similarity and artery disease</h3>
            <br/>
            <div style="float:right; width:260px;">
	          <img src="images/MRI.png" width="250" height="250" alt="projects" />
	        </div>
	        <div style="float:left; width:600px;">
		  	  <p> Dynamic similarity is the science of prototype scaling. Just like every airplane is first designed on a miniature scale, blood flow in the arteries can be large-scaled for prototyping. 3D printing patient vessels and experimentally reproducing the patient's blood flow was successfully demonstrated by our team. This new methodology enables assessment of detailed blood flow in the smallest and most inaccessible arteries, the arteries surrounding the heart. This has never been done before and opens many doors for exciting future research.  </p>
